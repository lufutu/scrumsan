- ✅ Successful account creation with failed auto sign-in
- ✅ Invalid password validation
- ✅ Non-existent invitation handling
- ✅ Already accepted invitation handling
- ✅ Expired invitation handling
- ✅ Existing user conflict handling
- ✅ Supabase authentication errors
- ✅ Missing password in request body
- ✅ Malformed JSON request handling
- ✅ Database transaction failures
- ✅ Various Supabase auth error scenarios

**Key Test Scenarios:**
- Complete successful flow with user creation and invitation acceptance
- All error conditions with appropriate HTTP status codes
- Transaction safety and rollback scenarios
- Authentication service integration errors
- Input validation and sanitization

## Test Statistics

### Total Test Coverage
- **Test Files:** 3 files
- **Total Tests:** 44 tests
- **Pass Rate:** 100% (44/44 passing)
- **Execution Time:** ~3.15 seconds

### Test Distribution
- **Component Tests:** 13 tests (AccountCreationForm)
- **Utility Tests:** 17 tests (user-existence-utils)
- **API Tests:** 14 tests (create-account endpoint)

## Requirements Coverage

### Requirement 4.1 - Password Security
✅ **Covered by:**
- Password strength validation tests
- Supabase authentication integration tests
- Password hashing verification through API tests

### Requirement 4.2 - User Record Creation
✅ **Covered by:**
- Successful account creation tests
- Database transaction tests
- User existence check tests

### Requirement 4.3 - Transaction Safety
✅ **Covered by:**
- Database transaction failure tests
- Error handling and rollback scenarios
- Orphaned record prevention tests

### Requirement 4.4 - Data Synchronization
✅ **Covered by:**
- Supabase auth and application database sync tests
- User creation with proper data flow tests
- Auto sign-in functionality tests

## Error Scenarios Tested

### Network & Connectivity
- Network timeouts
- Connection failures
- Service unavailability

### Authentication Errors
- Invalid credentials
- User already exists
- Weak password rejection
- Rate limiting

### Data Validation
- Invalid email formats
- Missing required fields
- Malformed request data
- Password strength requirements

### Business Logic
- Expired invitations
- Already accepted invitations
- Non-existent invitations
- Duplicate user creation attempts

## Test Quality Features

### Mocking Strategy
- Comprehensive Prisma database mocking
- Supabase client mocking with realistic responses
- Fetch API mocking for network simulation
- Proper mock cleanup between tests

### Async Testing
- Proper use of `waitFor` for async operations
- Timeout handling for long-running operations
- Promise-based test scenarios

### Edge Case Coverage
- Null and undefined input handling
- Empty data scenarios
- Boundary condition testing
- Error recovery testing

## Maintenance Notes

### Test Reliability
- All tests use proper mocking to avoid external dependencies
- Tests are isolated and don't affect each other
- Consistent test data setup and teardown

### Future Enhancements
- Tests are structured to easily accommodate new features
- Mock setup allows for easy addition of new error scenarios
- Modular test organization supports feature expansion

## Conclusion

The test suite provides comprehensive coverage of the invitation account creation feature, ensuring:
- All happy path scenarios work correctly
- Error conditions are handled gracefully
- Security requirements are met
- Data integrity is maintained
- User experience is consistent

All tests pass consistently and provide confidence in the feature's reliability and robustness.

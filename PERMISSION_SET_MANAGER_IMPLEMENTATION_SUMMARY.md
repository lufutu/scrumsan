### 3. Invoicing
- **View all invoicing**: Can see all invoices and billing data
- **Manage all invoicing**: Can create and edit any invoice
- **View assigned invoicing**: Can see invoices for assigned projects
- **Manage assigned invoicing**: Can edit invoices for assigned projects

### 4. Clients
- **View all clients**: Can see all client information
- **Manage all clients**: Can create, edit, and delete any client
- **View assigned clients**: Can see clients for assigned projects
- **Manage assigned clients**: Can edit clients for assigned projects

### 5. Worklogs
- **Manage all worklogs**: Can view and edit all time entries

## Validation Features

### Permission Dependencies

# Timeline Events API Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of the Timeline Events Management API for the team management feature.

## Implemented Endpoints

### 1. GET /api/organizations/[id]/members/[memberId]/timeline
- **Purpose**: Retrieve all timeline events for a specific organization member
- **Authentication**: Required (Supabase auth)
- **Authorization**: Member level access required; users can view their own timeline or admins/owners can view any member's timeline
- **Response**: Returns member info and array of timeline events with creator details
- **Features**:
  - Validates organization and member IDs
  - Checks user permissions
  - Orders events by date (descending)
  - Includes creator information for each event

### 2. POST /api/organizations/[id]/members/[memberId]/timeline
- **Purpose**: Create a new timeline event for a specific organization member
- **Authentication**: Required (Supabase auth)
- **Authorization**: Member level access required; users can add events to their own timeline or admins/owners can add to any member's timeline
- **Request Body**:
  ```json
  {
    "eventName": "string (required, max 255 chars)",
    "eventDate": "ISO datetime string (required)",
    "description": "string (optional, max 1000 chars)"
  }
  ```
- **Response**: Returns created timeline event with creator details
- **Features**:
  - Validates request body using Zod schema
  - Automatically sets creator to current user
  - Converts date string to Date object

### 3. PUT /api/organizations/[id]/members/[memberId]/timeline/[eventId]
- **Purpose**: Update an existing timeline event
- **Authentication**: Required (Supabase auth)
- **Authorization**: Users can edit events they created on their own timeline, or admins/owners can edit any event
- **Request Body**: Same as POST but all fields optional
- **Response**: Returns updated timeline event with creator details
- **Features**:
  - Validates event exists and belongs to the specified member
  - Checks if user has permission to edit the specific event
  - Supports partial updates (all fields optional)

### 4. DELETE /api/organizations/[id]/members/[memberId]/timeline/[eventId]
- **Purpose**: Delete a timeline event
- **Authentication**: Required (Supabase auth)
- **Authorization**: Users can delete events they created on their own timeline, or admins/owners can delete any event
- **Response**: Success message
- **Features**:
  - Validates event exists and belongs to the specified member
  - Checks if user has permission to delete the specific event
  - Permanently removes the event from database

## Validation Schemas

### Timeline Event Creation Schema
```typescript
export const timelineEventCreateSchema = z.object({
  eventName: z.string().min(1, 'Event name is required').max(255, 'Event name too long'),
  eventDate: z.string().datetime(),
  description: z.string().max(1000, 'Description too long').optional().nullable(),
})
```

### Timeline Event Update Schema
```typescript
export const timelineEventUpdateSchema = createUpdateSchema(timelineEventCreateSchema.shape)
```

## Security Features

### Permission Checks
- **Organization Membership**: All endpoints verify user is a member of the organization
- **Role-based Access**: Supports owner > admin > member hierarchy
- **Event Ownership**: Users can only edit/delete events they created (unless admin/owner)
- **Profile Access**: Users can only manage timeline events for their own profile (unless admin/owner)

### Input Validation
- **UUID Validation**: All ID parameters validated as proper UUIDs
- **Request Body Validation**: All request bodies validated using Zod schemas
- **Date Validation**: Event dates validated as proper ISO datetime strings
- **Length Limits**: Event names limited to 255 chars, descriptions to 1000 chars

### Error Handling
- **400 Bad Request**: Invalid input data or malformed UUIDs
- **403 Forbidden**: Insufficient permissions
- **404 Not Found**: Organization, member, or event not found
- **500 Internal Server Error**: Unexpected server errors

## Database Schema

The implementation uses the existing `TimelineEvent` model from the Prisma schema:

```prisma
model TimelineEvent {
  id                   String   @id @default(dbgenerated("gen_random_uuid()")) @db.Uuid
  organizationMemberId String   @map("organization_member_id") @db.Uuid
  eventName            String   @map("event_name")
  eventDate            DateTime @map("event_date") @db.Date
  description          String?
  createdBy            String   @map("created_by") @db.Uuid
  createdAt            DateTime @default(now()) @map("created_at") @db.Timestamptz

  // Relationships
  organizationMember OrganizationMember @relation(fields: [organizationMemberId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  creator            User               @relation("TimelineEventCreator", fields: [createdBy], references: [id])

  @@map("timeline_events")
}
```

## Testing

A comprehensive test script (`test-timeline-api.js`) has been created to test:
- All CRUD operations
- Validation error handling
- Invalid ID handling
- Permission checks
- Data integrity

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `app/api/organizations/[id]/members/[memberId]/timeline/route.ts`
- `app/api/organizations/[id]/members/[memberId]/timeline/[eventId]/route.ts`
- `test-timeline-api.js`
- `TIMELINE_API_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`

### Modified Files
- `lib/validation-schemas.ts` - Added timeline event validation schemas

## Requirements Fulfilled

This implementation fulfills **Requirement 7.3** from the team management specification:
- ✅ GET endpoint for retrieving timeline events
- ✅ POST endpoint for adding timeline events  
- ✅ PUT endpoint for updating timeline events
- ✅ DELETE endpoint for removing timeline events
- ✅ Proper authentication and authorization
- ✅ Input validation and error handling
- ✅ Database integration with existing schema

## Next Steps

The Timeline Events Management API is now complete and ready for integration with the frontend components. The next task in the implementation plan would be task 8: Custom Roles Management API.

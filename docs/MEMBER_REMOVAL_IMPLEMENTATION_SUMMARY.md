    }
    isVoluntaryLeave?: boolean     // Distinguishes self-leave vs admin removal
  }
  ```

- **Response:**
  ```typescript
  {
    message: string

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Board Selection for Removal
- ✅ Lists all boards where member has access through projects
- ✅ Allows selective removal from specific boards
- ✅ Maintains access to unchecked boards
- ✅ Shows board metadata (tasks, sprints, projects)

### 2. Ownership Transfer
- ✅ Required when organization owner leaves
- ✅ Dropdown to select new owner from admins/members
- ✅ Validates new owner exists and has proper permissions
- ✅ Atomic ownership transfer in database

### 3. Voluntary Leave vs Admin Removal
- ✅ Distinguishes between self-initiated leave and admin removal
- ✅ Different UI flows and permissions
- ✅ Proper validation for each scenario

### 4. Data Cleanup
- ✅ Cascading deletion of related records:
  - Project engagements
  - Time-off entries
  - Timeline events
  - Member profile data
- ✅ Transaction-based cleanup for data integrity
- ✅ Summary of cleaned up data in response

### 5. Permission Validation
- ✅ Admin/owner required for removing others
- ✅ Only owners can remove admins
- ✅ Self-removal allowed for own account
- ✅ Owner cannot be removed by others (must transfer ownership)

### 6. UI/UX Features
- ✅ Comprehensive removal dialog
- ✅ Board selection with "select all" option
- ✅ Impact summary showing what will be deleted
- ✅ Confirmation dialog for destructive actions
- ✅ Loading states and error handling
- ✅ Success messages and proper redirects

## Usage Examples

### Admin Removing a Member

// Simple voluntary leave
leaveOrganization()
```

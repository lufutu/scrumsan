# Add Member Button Not Showing - Fix Summary

## Problem
User is an organization owner (confirmed in database) but cannot see the "Add Member" button on the team management page.

## Root Cause
The team management page route was missing. The application was trying to link to `/organizations/[organizationId]/members` but this route didn't exist.

## Solution
Created the missing page route at `app/(app)/organizations/[organizationId]/members/page.tsx`.

## Files Created
- `app/(app)/organizations/[organizationId]/members/page.tsx`

## How to Access Team Management
1. Navigate to: `/organizations/[your-organization-id]/members`
2. Replace `[your-organization-id]` with your actual organization ID: `5739525e-b5a5-43c2-9c2f-e64066fedea1`
3. Full URL: `/organizations/5739525e-b5a5-43c2-9c2f-e64066fedea1/members`

## Expected Behavior
Once you navigate to the correct URL, you should see:
- ✅ Team Management page loads
- ✅ "Add Member" button appears in the header (since you're an owner)
- ✅ All team management functionality is available

## Alternative Access Methods
You can also access team management from:
1. Organization overview page → "Manage Members" button
2. Organization overview page → "View All Members" button

Both of these buttons should now work and take you to the team management page.

## Verification
To verify the fix works:
1. Go to `/organizations/5739525e-b5a5-43c2-9c2f-e64066fedea1/members`
2. Check that the "Add Member" button appears in the top-right corner
3. Click the button to open the member invitation dialog
4. Fill out the form to invite a new member

The system will automatically detect if the email belongs to an existing user or if an invitation needs to be sent.

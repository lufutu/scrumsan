# Prisma Client Fix Summary

## Problem
Error: `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'findUnique')`

The `createInvitation` function was trying to access `prisma.teamInvitation.findUnique()` but `prisma` was undefined within the function scope.

## Root Cause
The `createInvitation` function was defined outside the main API handler scope, so it didn't have access to the imported `prisma` client from the top of the file.

## Solution
Added a dynamic import of the prisma client within the `createInvitation` function:

```typescript
async function createInvitation(
  organizationId: string,
  email: string,
  role: 'admin' | 'member',
  permissionSetId?: string,
  jobTitle?: string,
  workingHoursPerWeek?: number,
  invitedBy: string
) {
  // Import prisma within the function to ensure it's available
  const { prisma } = await import('@/lib/prisma')
  
  try {
    // Now prisma.teamInvitation.findUnique() will work
    const existingInvitation = await prisma.teamInvitation.findUnique({
      // ... rest of the code
    })
  }
}
```

## Files Modified
- `app/api/organizations/[id]/members/route.ts`

## What This Fixes
- ✅ `prisma.teamInvitation.findUnique()` now works
- ✅ `prisma.teamInvitation.create()` now works
- ✅ All other prisma operations in the createInvitation function now work
- ✅ Invitation system should now function properly

## Testing
1. **Try sending an invitation** to a non-existing user in your app
2. **Run the test script**: Copy and paste `test-invitation-fix.js` content into your browser console
3. **Check the console logs** for success/error messages

## Expected Behavior After Fix
- ✅ No more "Cannot read properties of undefined" errors
- ✅ Invitations are created in the database
- ✅ Email sending is attempted (will log to console if SES not configured)
- ✅ Success message: "Invitation sent to [email]"

## Alternative Solutions Considered
1. **Move function inside handler**: Would work but makes the code less organized
2. **Pass prisma as parameter**: Would require changing function signature
3. **Use global prisma**: Not recommended for Next.js API routes

The dynamic import solution is clean and ensures the prisma client is always available when needed.

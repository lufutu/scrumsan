# Team Invitation System Implementation Summary

## Problem Solved
The system was requiring users to sign up first before being added to an organization. Now it supports sending email invitations to users who don't have accounts yet.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Database Schema
- ✅ Added `TeamInvitation` model to Prisma schema
- ✅ Created migration for `team_invitations` table
- ✅ Added relationships to User, Organization, and PermissionSet models

### 2. API Endpoints
- ✅ **Modified** `/api/organizations/[id]/members` POST endpoint to handle invitations
- ✅ **Created** `/api/invitations/[token]` GET endpoint to fetch invitation details
- ✅ **Created** `/api/invitations/[token]` POST endpoint to accept invitations

### 3. Utility Functions
- ✅ **Created** `lib/crypto-utils.ts` for secure token generation
- ✅ **Created** `lib/email-utils.ts` for sending invitation emails (with console logging for now)

### 4. User Interface
- ✅ **Created** `/invite/[token]` page for invitation acceptance
- ✅ **Created** `InvitationAcceptPage` component with full UX flow
- ✅ **Updated** existing `MemberInviteDialog` to work with new system

## How It Works

### For Existing Users
1. Admin enters email in "Add Member" dialog
2. System finds existing user
3. User is added directly to organization
4. Success message: "John Doe has been added to the organization"

### For New Users (Invitations)
1. Admin enters email in "Add Member" dialog
2. System doesn't find existing user
3. Creates invitation record in database
4. Sends invitation email (currently logs to console)
5. Success message: "Invitation sent to user@example.com"

### Invitation Acceptance Flow
1. User receives email with invitation link: `/invite/[token]`
2. User clicks link and sees invitation details
3. If not signed in: redirected to sign in, then back to invitation
4. If signed in with correct email: can accept invitation
5. Acceptance creates organization member record
6. User is redirected to organization dashboard

## Email Integration
Currently, invitation emails are logged to the console. To enable actual email sending:

1. Choose an email service (SendGrid, AWS SES, Resend, etc.)
2. Add environment variables for email service credentials
3. Update `lib/email-utils.ts` to use the chosen service
4. Replace console.log with actual email sending

## Security Features
- ✅ Secure token generation using crypto.randomBytes
- ✅ Invitation expiration (7 days)
- ✅ Email verification (invitation only works for intended email)
- ✅ Duplicate invitation prevention
- ✅ Already-member validation

## Database Schema Details

```sql
CREATE TABLE team_invitations (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  organization_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES organizations(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  email VARCHAR NOT NULL,
  role VARCHAR NOT NULL,
  permission_set_id UUID REFERENCES permission_sets(id),
  job_title VARCHAR,
  working_hours_per_week INTEGER DEFAULT 40,
  invited_by UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id),
  token VARCHAR UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  expires_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
  accepted_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
  accepted_by UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  UNIQUE(organization_id, email)
);
```

## Testing the System

### Test Invitation Flow
1. Go to team management page: `/organizations/[id]/members`
2. Click "Add Member" button
3. Enter email of non-existing user
4. Fill out role and other details
5. Click "Send Invitation"
6. Check console for invitation email details
7. Copy the invitation URL from console
8. Open URL in browser to test acceptance flow

### Test Direct Addition
1. Enter email of existing user
2. System should add them directly without invitation

## Next Steps
1. **Set up email service** - Replace console logging with actual email sending
2. **Add invitation management** - Allow admins to view/cancel pending invitations
3. **Add invitation reminders** - Send reminder emails for pending invitations
4. **Add bulk invitations** - Allow inviting multiple users at once

# Error Handling Improvement Requirements

## Introduction

This feature improves user experience by replacing thrown errors with user-friendly toast notifications throughout the application. Instead of crashing or showing technical error messages, users will see helpful feedback about what went wrong and how to proceed.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Replace Thrown Errors with Toast Messages

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see helpful error messages when something goes wrong, so that I understand what happened and can take appropriate action.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an operation fails THEN the system SHALL display a toast.error message instead of throwing an error
2. WHEN an error occurs THEN the error message SHALL be user-friendly and actionable
3. WHEN an API call fails THEN the system SHALL extract meaningful error messages from the response
4. WHEN a network error occurs THEN the system SHALL display appropriate connectivity messages
5. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL show specific validation error messages

### Requirement 2: Consistent Error Message Format

**User Story:** As a user, I want error messages to be consistent and clear, so that I can easily understand what went wrong.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying error messages THEN they SHALL follow a consistent format
2. WHEN an error has multiple causes THEN the system SHALL prioritize the most relevant message
3. WHEN technical errors occur THEN they SHALL be translated to user-friendly language
4. WHEN errors are displayed THEN they SHALL include actionable next steps when possible

### Requirement 3: Preserve Error Logging

**User Story:** As a developer, I want technical errors to still be logged for debugging, so that I can troubleshoot issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an error occurs THEN it SHALL be logged to the console for debugging
2. WHEN displaying user-friendly messages THEN the original error SHALL still be captured
3. WHEN errors are handled THEN they SHALL include relevant context information
4. WHEN logging errors THEN they SHALL include stack traces for debugging

### Requirement 4: Graceful Degradation

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to continue working even when some operations fail, so that I can complete other tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an error occurs THEN the application SHALL continue to function
2. WHEN operations fail THEN users SHALL be able to retry the action
3. WHEN errors happen THEN the UI SHALL remain responsive and usable
4. WHEN critical errors occur THEN users SHALL be guided to alternative actions

### Requirement 5: Error Recovery Options

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be able to recover from errors easily, so that I can complete my intended actions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN users SHALL be provided with retry options when appropriate
2. WHEN operations fail THEN users SHALL be guided to alternative approaches
3. WHEN validation fails THEN users SHALL see specific field-level guidance
4. WHEN network errors occur THEN users SHALL be informed about connectivity issues

# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing invitation system to allow new users (who don't have accounts yet) to create accounts directly from the invitation acceptance page. Currently, when a new user clicks an invitation link, they are redirected to the login page. This enhancement will detect if the user doesn't exist in the system and provide an account creation form where they can set their password, automatically log them in, and redirect them to the organization.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a new user receiving an invitation, I want to create my account directly from the invitation page, so that I can join the organization without having to navigate through separate signup flows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits an invitation link AND the user doesn't exist in the system THEN the system SHALL display an account creation form
2. WHEN the account creation form is displayed THEN the system SHALL show the invited user's email as read-only
3. WHEN the account creation form is displayed THEN the system SHALL require the user to enter a password
4. WHEN the user enters a password THEN the system SHALL validate the password meets security requirements (minimum 8 characters)
5. WHEN the user submits the account creation form THEN the system SHALL create the user account in Supabase
6. WHEN the account is successfully created THEN the system SHALL automatically log the user in
7. WHEN the user is logged in THEN the system SHALL automatically accept the invitation
8. WHEN the invitation is accepted THEN the system SHALL redirect the user to the organization dashboard

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a new user creating an account from an invitation, I want clear visual feedback about the account creation process, so that I understand what's happening and feel confident about joining the organization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the account creation form is displayed THEN the system SHALL show the organization name and invitation details
2. WHEN the user is creating their account THEN the system SHALL display loading states during the process
3. WHEN account creation fails THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages
4. WHEN account creation succeeds THEN the system SHALL show a success message before redirecting
5. WHEN the form is displayed THEN the system SHALL include privacy/terms consent similar to the reference image

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an existing user clicking an invitation link, I want the system to recognize I already have an account, so that I'm not prompted to create a duplicate account.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits an invitation link AND the user already exists in Supabase THEN the system SHALL show the existing login flow
2. WHEN an existing user is already logged in AND visits an invitation link THEN the system SHALL proceed directly to invitation acceptance
3. WHEN an existing user's email doesn't match the invitation email THEN the system SHALL show an appropriate error message

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the account creation process to be secure and follow best practices, so that new users' accounts are properly protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates an account THEN the system SHALL hash the password securely using Supabase's authentication
2. WHEN a user creates an account THEN the system SHALL create both the Supabase auth user and the application User record
3. WHEN account creation fails THEN the system SHALL not leave orphaned records in either system
4. WHEN a user creates an account THEN the system SHALL sync the user data between Supabase auth and the application database

# Member Profile Management API Implementation Summary

## Task Completed: 4. Member Profile Management API

### Requirements Implemented

**Requirement 7.1**: "WHEN a member accesses their profile THEN the system SHALL display Profile, Timeline, Time off, Engagements, and Boards tabs"
- ✅ **GET endpoint implemented**: `/api/organizations/[id]/members/[memberId]/profile`
- ✅ **Profile data retrieval**: Returns member profile information with proper access controls
- ✅ **Auto-creation**: Creates empty profile if none exists
- ✅ **Visibility controls**: Applies privacy settings based on user role and ownership

**Requirement 7.2**: "WHEN editing profile information THEN the system SHALL allow updates to contact details, social media links, and personal information"
- ✅ **PUT endpoint implemented**: `/api/organizations/[id]/members/[memberId]/profile`
- ✅ **Contact details**: secondaryEmail, phone, address
- ✅ **Social media links**: linkedin, skype, twitter
- ✅ **Personal information**: birthday, maritalStatus, family, other
- ✅ **Visibility settings**: Configurable privacy controls per field

## Implementation Details

### API Endpoints Created

1. **GET /api/organizations/[id]/members/[memberId]/profile**
   - Retrieves member profile data
   - Creates empty profile if none exists
   - Applies visibility filters based on user permissions
   - Returns filtered data based on access level

2. **PUT /api/organizations/[id]/members/[memberId]/profile**
   - Updates member profile information
   - Validates all input data using Zod schemas
   - Supports partial updates
   - Handles date conversion for birthday field
   - Maintains visibility settings

### Validation Schemas Added

Added to `lib/validation-schemas.ts`:
- `visibilitySchema`: Controls field visibility (admin/member)
- `memberProfileCreateSchema`: Validation for profile creation
- `memberProfileUpdateSchema`: Validation for profile updates

### Security Features Implemented

1. **Access Control**
   - Organization membership verification
   - Role-based permissions (owner > admin > member)
   - Own profile access for all members
   - Admin/owner access to all profiles

2. **Visibility Controls**
   - Field-level privacy settings
   - Admin-only vs member-visible fields
   - Own profile always fully visible
   - Configurable per field

3. **Input Validation**
   - Email format validation
   - String length limits
   - Date format validation
   - Enum validation for visibility settings

### Data Model Support

The implementation uses the existing `MemberProfile` model from the Prisma schema:
- `secondaryEmail`: Optional secondary email address
- `address`: Physical address
- `phone`: Phone number
- `linkedin`: LinkedIn profile URL
- `skype`: Skype username
- `twitter`: Twitter handle
- `birthday`: Date of birth
- `maritalStatus`: Marital status
- `family`: Family information
- `other`: Additional information
- `visibility`: JSON object controlling field visibility

### Error Handling

- **400 Bad Request**: Invalid input data or malformed UUIDs
- **403 Forbidden**: Insufficient permissions
- **404 Not Found**: Member or organization not found
- **500 Internal Server Error**: Database or server errors

### Testing

Created comprehensive test scenarios covering:
- Input validation edge cases
- Visibility logic for different user roles
- Access control scenarios
- Profile data CRUD operations

## Files Created/Modified

1. **Created**: `app/api/organizations/[id]/members/[memberId]/profile/route.ts`
   - Main API endpoint implementation
   - GET and PUT methods
   - Complete access control and validation

2. **Modified**: `lib/validation-schemas.ts`
   - Added member profile validation schemas
   - Added visibility control schema

3. **Created**: Test files for validation and API structure verification

## Compliance with Requirements

✅ **Requirement 7.1**: Profile access with proper data display
✅ **Requirement 7.2**: Profile editing with contact details, social media, and personal information
✅ **Access Control**: Proper permission checks based on visibility settings
✅ **Validation**: Comprehensive input validation for profile data
✅ **Privacy Settings**: Configurable visibility controls per field

## Next Steps

This implementation provides the foundation for the member profile management system. The endpoints are ready for integration with the frontend components that will be implemented in subsequent tasks.

# Variable Initialization Fix Summary

## Problem
Runtime error: "Cannot access 'membersArray' before initialization" in `components/team-management/TeamManagementPage.tsx` at line 134.

The error occurred because `membersArray` was being used in a `useMemo` hook before it was declared later in the code.

## Root Cause
JavaScript hoisting issue where the variable was referenced before its declaration:

```typescript
// This was happening BEFORE membersArray was declared
const shouldUseVirtualScrolling = useMemo(() => {
  return membersArray.length > 100  // ❌ Error: membersArray not yet declared
}, [membersArray.length])

// membersArray was declared later
const membersArray = Array.isArray(members) ? members : []
```

## Solution
Reordered the code to declare `membersArray` immediately after the `useTeamMembers` hook and before it's used in the `shouldUseVirtualScrolling` useMemo:

```typescript
// Fetch team members with performance optimizations
const { 
  members, 
  isLoading: membersLoading, 
  error: membersError,
} = useTeamMembers(organizationId, debouncedFilters, {
  enableOptimisticUpdates: true,
})

// Check user permissions - ensure members is an array
const membersArray = Array.isArray(members) ? members : []

// Performance optimization: Determine if we should use virtual scrolling
const shouldUseVirtualScrolling = useMemo(() => {
  return membersArray.length > 100  // ✅ Now membersArray is available
}, [membersArray.length])
```

## Files Modified
- `components/team-management/TeamManagementPage.tsx`

## Impact
- ✅ Fixed runtime error preventing the team management page from loading
- ✅ Maintained all existing functionality
- ✅ No breaking changes to component behavior
- ✅ Performance optimization logic remains intact

## Testing
The fix resolves the variable initialization error while preserving the defensive programming approach that ensures `members` is always treated as an array to prevent "find is not a function" errors.
